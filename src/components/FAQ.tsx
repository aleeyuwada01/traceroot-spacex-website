      question: 'How long does a Mikrotik router setup take?',
      answer: 'Basic configurations typically take 2-4 hours for remote setup. Advanced hotspot configurations with Mikhmon integration can take 6-8 hours. On-site installations may require additional time depending on network complexity and physical setup requirements.'

    },
    {
      id: 'pricing-packages',
      question: 'Can I upgrade from Basic to Advanced package later?',
      answer: 'Absolutely! Our packages are designed to build upon each other. You can start with Basic Configuration and upgrade to Standard, Advanced, or Premium packages as your business grows. We\'ll credit your previous investment toward the upgrade.'
    },
    {
      id: 'equipment-supply',
      question: 'Do you supply the networking equipment or just configuration?',
      answer: 'We offer both services! You can purchase equipment through our shop section (Starlink kits, Mikrotik routers, access points, etc.) or we can configure your existing equipment. We provide personalized quotes for equipment and installation packages.'
    },
    {
      id: 'payment-terms',
      question: 'What are your payment terms and methods?',
      answer: 'We accept bank transfers, mobile money payments, and installment plans for larger projects. For equipment purchases, we require 100% payment upfront.

    },
    {
      id: 'warranty-guarantee',
      question: 'What warranty do you provide on configurations?',

    },
    {
      id: 'remote-vs-onsite',
      question: 'What\'s the difference between remote and on-site configuration?',
      answer: 'Remote configuration is done via secure VPN or TeamViewer for software setup, ideal for most router configurations. On-site service includes physical installation, cable management, access point mounting, and hands-on training. We recommend on-site for complex multi-device setups.'
